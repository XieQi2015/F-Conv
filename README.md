F-Convs are rotation equivariant convolutions with high representation accuracy, which can perform better on low-level computer vision tasks as comparsion with pervious rotation equivariant convolution methods.

Rotation symmetry on local features is a important structure characteristics of image, which can be hardly captured by commonly used CNN, as shown in the folliwing figure:

We can also observe that the proposed F-Conv is expected to better maintain the symmetry of local features underlying the image, which should be help for the computer vision tasks.
