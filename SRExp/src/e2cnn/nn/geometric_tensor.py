class GeometricTensor:
    
    def __init__(self, tensor: Tensor, type: FieldType):
        r"""
        
        A GeometricTensor can be interpreted as a *typed* tensor.
        It is wrapping a common :class:`torch.Tensor` and endows it with a (compatible) :class:`~e2cnn.nn.FieldType` as
        *transformation law*.
        
        The :class:`~e2cnn.nn.FieldType` describes the action of a group :math:`G` on the tensor.
        This action includes both a transformation of the base space and a transformation of the channels according to
        a :math:`G`-representation :math:`\rho`.
        
        All *e2cnn* neural network operations have :class:`~e2cnn.nn.GeometricTensor` s as inputs and outputs.
        They perform a dynamic typechecking, ensuring that the transformation laws of the data and the operation match.
        See also :class:`~e2cnn.nn.EquivariantModule`.
 
        As usual, the first dimension of the tensor is interpreted as the batch dimension. The second is the fiber
        (or channel) dimension, which is associated with a group representation by the field type. The following
        dimensions are the spatial dimensions (like in a conventional CNN).
        
        The operations of **addition** and **scalar multiplication** are supported.
        For example::
        
            gs = e2cnn.gspaces.Rot2dOnR2(8)
            type = e2cnn.nn.FieldType(gs, [gs.regular_repr]*3)
            t1 = e2cnn.nn.GeometricTensor(torch.randn(1, 24, 3, 3), type)
            t2 = e2cnn.nn.GeometricTensor(torch.randn(1, 24, 3, 3), type)
            
            # addition
            t3 = t1 + t2
            
            # scalar product
            t3 = t1 * 3.
            
            # scalar product also supports tensors containing only one scalar
            t3 = t1 * torch.tensor(3.)
            
            # inplace operations are also supported
            t1 += t2
            t2 *= 3.
        
        .. warning ::
            The multiplication of a PyTorch tensor containing only a scalar with a GeometricTensor is only supported
            when using PyTorch 1.4 or higher (see this `issue <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/26333>`_ )
            
        A GeometricTensor supports **slicing** in a similar way to PyTorch's :class:`torch.Tensor`.
        More precisely, slicing along the batch (1st) and the spatial (3rd, 4th, ...) dimensions works as usual.
        However, slicing the fiber (2nd) dimension would break equivariance when splitting channels belonging to
        the same field.
        To prevent this, slicing on the second dimension is defined over *fields* instead of channels.
        
        .. warning ::
            
            GeometricTensor only supports basic *slicing* but it does **not** support *advanced indexing* (see NumPy's
            documentation about
            `indexing <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#basic-slicing-and-indexing>`_
            for more details).
            Moreover, in contrast to NumPy and PyTorch, an index containing a single integer value **does not** reduce
            the dimensionality of the tensor.
            In this way, the resulting tensor can always be interpreted as a GeometricTensor.
            
        
        We give few examples to illustrate this behavior::
        
            # Example of GeometricTensor slicing

        .. warning ::
        
            *Slicing* over the fiber (2nd) dimension with ``step > 1`` or with a negative step is converted
            into *indexing* over the channels.
            This means that, in these cases, slicing behaves like *advanced indexing* in PyTorch and NumPy
            **returning a copy instead of a view**.
            For more details, see the *note* `here <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_view.html>`_ and

            Indeed, depending on the values which are assigned, this operation can break the symmetry of the tensor
            which may not transform anymore according to its transformation law (specified by ``type``).
            In case this feature is necessary, one can directly access the underlying :class:`torch.Tensor`, e.g.
            ``geom_tensor.tensor[:3, :, 2:5, 2:5] = torch.randn(3, 4, 3, 3)``, although this is not recommended.

        More precisely, slicing along the batch (1st) and the spatial (3rd, 4th, ...) dimensions works as usual.
        However, slicing along the channel dimension could break equivariance by splitting the channels belonging to the
        same field.
        For this reason, slicing on the second dimension is not defined over the channels but over fields.
        
        When a continuous (step=1) slice is used over the fields/channels dimension (the 2nd axis), it is converted
        into a continuous slice over the channels.
        This is not possible when the step is greater than 1 or negative.
        In such cases, the slice over the fields needs to be converted into an index over the channels.
        
        Moreover, when a single integer is used to index an axis, that axis is not discarded as in PyTorch but is
        preserved with size 1.
        
        Slicing is not supported for setting values inside the tensor (i.e. :meth:`object.__setitem__`
